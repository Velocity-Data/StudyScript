These scripts are built for preping for Networking exams such as A+, CCNA, MCSA Net+ etc.

To choose the questions you would like to use, then you must change the variables at the top of the script.

If you want to change the questions being asked you can just edit the .txt file or more preferably, 
you can just make your own text file with questions relating to an exam of your choosing. Just make sure to be wary 
of the spaces and formatting within the text files, if they are off the program wont run correctly.
